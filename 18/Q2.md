1. **Difference Between Normal Queue, Priority Queue, and LIFO Queue:**

   - **Normal Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out):** In a normal queue, elements are added to the end and removed from the front, following the first-in-first-out principle. A real-world example is a line at a grocery store checkout. The first person to get in line is the first one to be served.

   - **Priority Queue:** In a priority queue, each element has a priority assigned to it, and the element with the highest priority is served first, regardless of the order in which elements are added. A real-world example is a hospital emergency room, where patients with more severe conditions are treated before those with less critical conditions, regardless of arrival time.

   - **LIFO Queue (Stack):** A LIFO queue, or stack, serves elements in the last-in-first-out order. The last element added is the first to be removed. A real-world example is a stack of plates in a cafeteria; the last plate placed on top is the first one taken for use.

2. **Portions of the Code from queue.py:**

   the methods from the `Queue` class, `PriorityQueue` class, and `LifoQueue` class

   - **Queue Class:**

     ```python
     def _init(self, maxsize):
         self.queue = deque()

     def _qsize(self):
         return len(self.queue)

     def _put(self, item):
         self.queue.append(item)

     def _get(self):
         return self.queue.popleft()
     ```

   - **PriorityQueue Class:**

     ```python
     def _init(self, maxsize):
         self.queue = []

     def _qsize(self):
         return len(self.queue)

     def _put(self, item):
         heappush(self.queue, item)

     def _get(self):
         return heappop(self.queue)
     ```

   - **LifoQueue Class:**

     ```python
     def _init(self, maxsize):
         self.queue = []

     def _qsize(self):
         return len(self.queue)

     def _put(self, item):
         self.queue.append(item)

     def _get(self):
         return self.queue.pop()
     ```

3. **Explanation of How the Queue Class is Used as a Template:**

   - **Similarities:**

     - All three classes use the same method names (`_init`, `_qsize`, `_put`, `_get`), which indicates that they share the same interface for queue operations.
     - They all use a data structure to store the items, and the methods are synchronized using threading primitives to ensure thread safety(Implementation is guaranteed to be free of race conditions when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously).
     - The `put` and `get` methods in all classes follow the same pattern of blocking and non-blocking operations with optional timeouts.

   - **Differences:**
     - The underlying data structure: `Queue` uses a `deque`, `PriorityQueue` uses a list along with the `heapq` module to maintain priority, and `LifoQueue` uses a list to implement stack behavior.
     - The `_put` and `_get` methods are implemented differently to accommodate the behavior of each type of queue. For example, `PriorityQueue` uses `heappush` and `heappop` to maintain the elements in priority order, while `LifoQueue` uses `append` and `pop` to add/remove elements from the end of the list, implementing stack behavior.
     - The `PriorityQueue` and `LifoQueue` classes override the `_init`, `_qsize`, `_put`, and `_get` methods of the `Queue` class to provide their specific functionality.

   The `Queue` class acts as a template by providing a general structure and a set of operations that are common to all queue types. The `PriorityQueue` and `LifoQueue` classes inherit from `Queue` and customize these operations to implement the specific behavior required for a priority queue and a LIFO queue, respectively. This is a classic example of the Template Method design pattern, where a base class defines the structure of an algorithm, and subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
