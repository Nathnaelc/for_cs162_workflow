1. help(t): This will display the docstring and some basic information about the class BlankClass. It's useful for understanding what a class or object does.

2. type(t): This will return the type of the object t, which in this case is BlankClass. It's useful for determining the class type of an object.

3. dir(t): This will list all the attributes and methods that the object t has. It's useful for introspection to know what methods and attributes are available for an object.

4. hash(t): This will return the hash value of the object t. Objects of the same type and value will return the same hash. It's useful for using objects as keys in dictionaries.

5. id(t): This will return the unique ID for the object t. It's useful for debugging and understanding object identity.

6. hasattr(my_attr, 'x3'): This will return True if the object my_attr has an attribute x3. It's useful for conditional checks before accessing attributes.

7. getattr(my_attr, 'x3'): This will return the value of the attribute x3 from the object my_attr. It's useful for dynamically accessing attributes.

8. delattr(my_attr, 'x3'): This will delete the attribute x3 from the object my_attr. It's useful for removing attributes dynamically.

9. vars(my_attr): This will return the **dict** attribute of the object my_attr, which is a dictionary containing the objectâ€™s attributes. It's useful for debugging and introspection.

10. bool(t): This will return True because custom objects are truthy by default. It's useful for conditional checks involving objects.
